# This is a Frontend Assignment
## Note :  
###  I used React persist which store data in your local storage which means that even if you close browser your redux state( goals completed, left etc) will be saved in local storage ,if you want to not save redux state :  go in incoginato mode in chrome and close that tab and reopen same page
